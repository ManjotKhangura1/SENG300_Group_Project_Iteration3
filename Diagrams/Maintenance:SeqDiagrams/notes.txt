NOTES:

I chose to ommit smaller details in the listeners as well as the specefic cases that happen within the hardware when a function is called.
These diagrams show a much more high-level understanding of what is happening, and assuming that flags and variables are used appropriately in the controller, 
the hardware implementation should be negligible
